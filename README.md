# Connected-Component-Analysis-on-Binary-Images
This project involves creating a Java program that loads a binary image into a boolean array where white pixels represent objects of interest and black pixels are the
background, and with the implementation of Union-find, which identifies connected
components and classify the shapes as rectangles or triangles and sort them based on size
and position.
